Legacy Files Go Poof
==========

The Moodle Legacy Files Go Poof plugin for TinyMCE

This attempts to move legacy files in the text area over into the new Moodle 2 file system. It adds a single poof icon (a cloud) to the editor toolbar. When text is selected the icon becomes enabled. Images and other resources linked to with /file.php/ in the url will be fetched and moved over.

It also works with old PoodLL filter links to audio and video files. 

If you turn off legacy files first, then go into an html area with legacy file images, they will appear as broken links. When you select them and press the "legacy files go poof" icon, a dialog will appear showing a list of files to fetch and replace. If you click "insert" it will do the fetch and replace.

NB It does not work in TinyMCE full screen mode.
